*   **üîå Public API**: A free and open API to programmatically access all flag and profile data, allowing developers to integrate Robify's data into their own applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, efficient, and scalable technology stack:

*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** - The runtime environment for this project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Robify's backend is designed for efficiency and real-time data delivery:

1.  **Data Fetching**: A server-side service (`fflagService.js`) automatically fetches the latest Fast Flags from the `Roblox-FFlag-Tracker` repository every 5 minutes.
2.  **Data Caching**: The fetched data is stored in an in-memory cache to ensure fast response times for all API requests.
3.  **Data Enrichment**: The raw flag data is merged with local metadata from `flags.json` and `profiles.json` to provide additional context like descriptions, categories, and performance profiles.
4.  **API Layer**: The Next.js API routes serve the cached and enriched data to the frontend, ensuring the UI is always up-to-date.
